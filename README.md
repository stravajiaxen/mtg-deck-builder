# Playing with Magic Cards

I want to analyze my collection to see what good commanders I could use
 - I can select a collection
 - I can upload a collection from an excel sheet
 - I can link decks to become collections from Moxfield
 - I can select multiple collections for my analysis

 - I am presented the most expensive collection of cards from my collection
 -   I can save that as a new collection
 - I am presented the most number of cards from my collection

I want to manage the saved "collections" I have
 - I can add new collections
 - 

I want to understand how a particular commander could benefit from my collection
 i.e. what kind of commander deck could I build for that commander?

I want to compare a list of cards I might want to buy against my collection
 - I want to find out where a card is
   - I can select a card
   - I can see which collections contain that card
 - I can give a list of cards or a pair of collections and compare them to see them
