OK, so go to
https://edhrec.com/decks/zaxara-the-exemplary
and you'll see in the network a link to a json file like
https://json.edhrec.com/pages/decks/zaxara-the-exemplary.json
If you go into the json file you'll see a bunch of links to a bunch of decks
that you can look at (see "table") with all the deets for the deck.

Each deck preview is another json file like this
https://json.edhrec.com/v2/deckpreview-temp/qPmdGyFT-CfpGLlLmpcS6A.json
go to the json file and look at the cards. Voila! You now have a deck :D
